# Bowling Game Kata (Uncle Bob's Version)

### Completed Friday 1st Nov 2019 Key learnings:

Code should be refactored to be self documentating when possible - eg: isSpare and isStrike instead of comments next to ambiguous expressions.

It is ok to tolerate poorly written code in the name of making it work, with the view towards refactoring it later and making it right.
